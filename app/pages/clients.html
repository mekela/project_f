        <p>
                We have a tendency to work with larger multinational organisations often trading in consumer goods, who we have found complement the range of services that we provide and obtain maximum value from them. That said, we are always open to enquiries from interested parties from any industry or sector and in reference to any new country opening.

                <p>In over 25 year of collaboration personally with Alex Rashkovan and in cooperation with team Filuet I am loaded with compliments and admiration as to the growth and professionalism they have achieved. We had the opportunity to operate together in multitude of countries, varying economies, challenging conditions of infrastructure and technology and always managed to find creative yet structured and compliant ways to overcome and set up businesses, transform services or update operations at high level of success. </p>
                <p>It’s the trust and confidence we have in their executive team and their ‘no problem’ approach that allowed us this long term affiliation. Add to it their willingness to address small projects, as well as big ones, and take the time to understand our business and needs, and we have a winning formula.   </p>      
                <p>In my various positions at Herbalife Nutrition I was responsible to managing various regions of the world as well as Business Development & International Expansion which includes new country opening. I have the experience in working with a variety of suppliers and set up Import and Distribution by ourselves and by utilising 3rd party operations.  Filuet certainly amongst highest performing partners we had.</p>

Through our vast experience, we have found Filuet to be the one that really stands out from the crowd as the true "solutions" based company. Their innovative operational approach coupled with their unique range of services makes Filuet the only choice when looking
                        to procure the services of a third party."</p>

                <p>"Our company has been doing business with Filuet over the past two decades. Throughout that time, Filuet has been a trusted and reliable partner. They take a "can do" attitude into each project, consistently finding solutions which best support our Distributors' needs, while meeting all our corporate requirements. <br>
                        I can say that in each case, they have exceeded my expectations in the quality of management and execution of detail for each of the projects we have collaborated on. <br>
                        It is rare to find companies that truly fit the description of a "business partner". Filuet is one of those companies. We have tremendous respect for their ability to deliver against their word and we have found that Filuet shows the same level of respect to our Distributors and to our company's mission and values."
